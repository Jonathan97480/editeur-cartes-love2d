fix: template overlay resolution

- Add original_img field to separate source from display image  
- Image generation now always uses original image as source
- Remove cartes.db from Git tracking (contains user data)
- Automatic migration of existing cards
- Enhanced debug messages for better traceability

Fixes issue where changing rarity multiple times created template overlay
